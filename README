I choose programm 5 - demonstration random events.
Double click on element in list events removed it.
If field name is empty the event will be named 'New event' + number of no named.
If field chance is empty or has incorrect format the chance will be 100%.
You can enter the seed of generation (press "Enter" set it)
If field number of simulation is empty it will work 1 time.
Works all basic opportunites.
Also you can enter seed of generation and see statictic about events.
All number must be between 1 and 1000, size of name < 20.
